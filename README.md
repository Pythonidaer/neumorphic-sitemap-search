# Sitemap Search Filter

This website allows users to upload an XML sitemap file. It then parses the file to extract all `<loc>` URLs, and displays them in a neuomorphic, muted grey/white styled layout. A search bar is provided to filter the URLs based on the path (i.e., the portion after `.com`).

## Features

- **XML Upload:**  
  Users can upload a sitemap XML file (generated by tools such as [mysitemapgenerator](http://www.mysitemapgenerator.com)).

- **XML Parsing:**  
  The webpage parses the uploaded XML file and extracts all `<loc>` URL elements.

- **Neuomorphic Design:**  
  The webpage features a soft, modern design using neuomorphic styling for the search bar and URL list items.

- **Search Functionality:**  
  A search bar filters the list of URLs by matching the search query against the path (the portion after `.com`). This helps to quickly find specific sections of the sitemap without being overwhelmed by common elements.

## Example XML Sitemap

Below is an example of what your XML sitemap file should look like. (Note: the URLs have been made up for this example.)

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!--  created with www.mysitemapgenerator.com  -->
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://www.exampleco.com/</loc>
